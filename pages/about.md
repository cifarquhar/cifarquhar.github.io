# **About Me**

Hello, I'm Colin.

I'm part of the instructor team at [CodeClan](https://www.codeclan.com) where we deliver courses in software development and data anlysis to people looking to change their career. When I'm teaching I find that a lot of the questions I get asked aren't so much about the fundamentals of programming but instead about what we *could* do with the concepts we just been discussing. That often inspires me to look at the same tech and poke around at the edges of it to see how (or even if) I can mess about with it.

That's what this blog wil be all about. Some of the projects I'll show will be fairly straight-forward, but some will include quite a bit of experimentation. I'll write them up as best I can and publish some blog posts to explain each as I go. As the title suggests, I will *definitely* be over-thinking some of it.
